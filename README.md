# Klarna UI Components

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/klarna/ui.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/klarna/ui)
[![npm version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/@klarna/ui.svg?maxAge=10000)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@klarna/ui)

This library contains the basic set of components used by multiple front end projects across Klarna. It exposes [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/) API compatible components as well as CSS modules.

## Install

```sh
npm install @klarna/ui --save
```

You can use the UI components either with [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/) and [Preact](https://preactjs.com/). [Learn more in the docs](https://github.com/klarna/ui/wiki/Preact).

React and React-Motion are peer-dependencies of this project, meaning that if you intend to consume the components from within your own project, you must make sure to have React and React-Motion available. The easiest way is to add them as dependencies of your project:

```sh
npm install react react-motion --save
```

This package doesn't have a build, so you must have a Babel pipeline to use it. [Read more about how to config it](https://github.com/klarna/ui/wiki/Webpack-config).

## Contributing

Make sure:

1. Your contribution is aligned with the styleguide.
2. Your contribution doesn't break the grid. To avoid that, always use the `$grid` variable to define your sizes, as in `line-height: ($grid * 4)`. As a rule of thumb, if your element total height (sum of content, paddings, margins, etc.) has an integer multiple of `$grid` you should be good.
3. Your code is linted: `npm run lint`.
4. It works in the major browsers, the simplest way is to spawn [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) and use the cloud service of your choice. Else, you can download IE virtual machines for VirtualBox using `curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/xdissent/ievms/master/ievms.sh | env IEVMS_VERSIONS="9" bash`.

Then:

1. Send a PR.
2. Once approved (with üëç reaction or a _LGTM_ comment):
  1. Merge to master
  2. Pull master locally
  3. Update the version using `npm version <major|minor|patch> -m "Some message describing what happened"` (tag will have `v` prefix). The message will be published as the [release notes in Github](https://github.com/klarna/ui/releases).
  4. Push master and the new tag as well. (`git push origin master --follow-tags`)
  5. Go to https://github.com/klarna/ui/releases, click on "Draft a new release" and add notes for your release version. Make sure to enter the number of your release including the `v` in the "Tag version" field, ie. `v4.13.2`

Travis will take care of publishing your new version to npm. In a matter of minutes it should be ready. You can check the status of the release publication by reading the log of the build corresponding to your tag. The list of Travis builds can be found in https://travis-ci.org/klarna/ui/builds
